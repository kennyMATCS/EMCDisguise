# EMCDisguise
EMCDisguise is a Spigot plugin that disguises players as entities.
If a disguised player is attacked, their disguise will be removed. However, this will not occur if they attack someone else.
## Permissions
`disguise.<entity>` Allows a player to use the specified entity disguise. <br>
`disguise.manage` Allows a player to use `/disguise reload`
## Commands
`/disguise [entity]` Opens the disguise gui; alternatively if the player specifies an entity in the command, they will be disguised as that entity.
